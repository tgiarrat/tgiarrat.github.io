## Roasty Toasty
 **_By Thomas Giarratana_**

**Idea**
- The idea behind my project was to create a cozy scene where the user roasts AND toasts marshmallows by a campfire.

**Features of the project**: 
  - Model a fire using particles
  - First person view of a marshmallow on a stick that follows the cameras movements
  - Changing the texture of the marshmallow over time as it gets roasted
  - Camera movement
  - Textured objects
  - Skybox
  
**Controls / Rules**
  - WASD + mouse to move the camera
  - space to reset the marshmallow
  - Camera must be within a sort distance of the fire to roast the marshmallow
