## Daily Hub Application
 **_By Thomas Giarratana_**

### Overview

This app is intended to put all of the information that i check daily into one simple to use place. Currently, the basic idea behind the app works. The user is able to view weather and thier preferred selection of news sources. However, I was unable to meet my original scope where I hoped for charts, stocks, and possibly grades to be present. While I wasnt able to meet my intended scope I feel what the functionality that is present works basically as I envisioned it. 

### Basic Application Flow
- When the user first opens the application they will only see the default weather card (San Luis Obispo)

- to change your preferred news sources navigate to the options menu again

- To remove news sources (for now) simply select the x on each of the news cards
